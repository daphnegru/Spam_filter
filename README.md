# topics_in_network_security
This is a mini project in the course "Topics in Network Security".

The spam filter in this project uses regexes in order to find whether a spam phrase was inserted to the subject or the text of the email.

At the end of checking all the emails received a report is generated informing the admin how much spam mails each user got.
