# topics_in_network_security
This is a mini project in the course "Topics in Network Security"

In this project I created a spam filter that gets an email message and using statistics chooses whether to add a spam phrase, and if so where to add it (subject or content).

After sending all the emails there is a report generated in order for the admin user to know how many spam mails each user in their organization got.
